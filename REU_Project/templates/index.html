                                ENGagED REU was a research experience centered 
                                around engineering education. As a part of this 
                                program, I learned about different reseach 
                                methods including qualitative and quantitative 
                                work, I learned about different methods of data 
                                analysis such as transcript coding and 
                                qualitative data analysis, and I learned how to 
                                convey my research findings.
                            </p>
                            <p>This process has allowed me to get a greater 
                                understanding of problems within the engineering 
                                education system and how they effect my journey. 
                                While you could say engineering education 
                                is nothing more than a curriculm, the research 
                                I have come across proves that be a successful 
                                engineer, multiple things need to be considered 
                                such as the history of the field, the mental 
                                health of the participants, the presence of 
                                leadership in the field, and more.

            There are preconceived notions of what an engineer should be. 
            Though we are living in a growingly diverse world, engineers 
            continue to be seen as white men with a monolithic point of view. 
            This image has created an exclusive environment through 
            discouraging the participation of people of color and discouraging 
            diversity of thought. This discouragement has placed serious 
            limitations on the progression of the engineering field  due to its 
            limited perspective on problems that effect more than just the 
            predominate group in the field.
        </p>
        <p> Black and Latinx engineers in leadership positions encourages 
            their success in the field and have the power to provide the field 
            with the perspective it desperately needs. While diversity of 
            students, staff, and thought are crucial to expanding the 
            perspective of the engineering field, this perspective can only be 
            provided if it is accepted by individuals in the field. Leaders 
            ability to inspire others to believe a mission or aim for a 
            particular goal equips marginalized engineering leaders with 
            the skills to provide the perspective shift that is needed in the 
            engineering field. Leadership also equips marginalized engineer 
            with the skills to reach levels of success that wouldnâ€™t have 
            possible for other marginalized engineers. This study established 
            archetypes of leadership that allow Black and Latinx engineers to 
            suceed in the field. In this context, success is defined as the 
            academic and professional success, excluding satisfaction in the 
            field.
