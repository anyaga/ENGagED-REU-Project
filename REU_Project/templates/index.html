                                ENGagED REU was a research experience centered 
                                around engineering education. As a part of this 
                                program, I learned about different reseach 
                                methods including qualitative and quantitative 
                                work, I learned about different methods of data 
                                analysis such as transcript coding and 
                                qualitative data analysis, and I learned how to 
                                convey my research findings.
                            </p>
                            <p>This process has allowed me to get a greater 
                                understanding of problems within the engineering 
                                education system and how they effect my journey. 
                                While you could say engineering education 
                                is nothing more than a curriculm, the research 
                                I have come across proves that be a successful 
                                engineer, multiple things need to be considered 
                                such as the history of the field, the mental 
                                health of the participants, the presence of 
                                leadership in the field, and more.

            There are preconceived notions of what an engineer should be. 
            Though we are living in a growingly diverse world, engineers 
            continue to be seen as white men with a monolithic point of view. 
            This image has created an exclusive environment through 
            discouraging the participation of people of color and discouraging 
            diversity of thought. This discouragement has placed serious 
            limitations on the progression of the engineering field  due to its 
            limited perspective on problems that effect more than just the 
            predominate group in the field.
        </p>
        <p> Black and Latinx engineers in leadership positions encourages 
            their success in the field and have the power to provide the field 
            with the perspective it desperately needs. While diversity of 
            students, staff, and thought are crucial to expanding the 
            perspective of the engineering field, this perspective can only be 
            provided if it is accepted by individuals in the field. Leaders 
            ability to inspire others to believe a mission or aim for a 
            particular goal equips marginalized engineering leaders with 
            the skills to provide the perspective shift that is needed in the 
            engineering field. Leadership also equips marginalized engineer 
            with the skills to reach levels of success that wouldn’t have 
            possible for other marginalized engineers. This study established 
            archetypes of leadership that allow Black and Latinx engineers to 
            suceed in the field. In this context, success is defined as the 
            academic and professional success, excluding satisfaction in the 
            field.

        <h2><strong>Participants</strong></h2>
        <p><img src="images/part_graph.png" alt="particapants graph"
            style="float:right;width:600px">
            This study focuses on the stories of five Black and/or Latinx 
            engineering students and young professionals. Their stories 
            provided ensite on the experience of Black and Latinx individuals 
            in engieering education and the professional world. Semi-structured 
            interviews lasting between 1-2 hours were conducted. Each interview 
            was audio-recorded and transcribed. Of the five participants, one 
            was a graduate student and the remaining were young professionals. 
            Two identified as men, two identified as female and one identified 
            as femme-presenting. Their majors included mechanical engineering, 
            civil engineering, chemical engineering, and industrial engineering. 
            Thematic analysis was used to identify leadership archetypes and 
            how their display of leadership allowed them to succeed in their 
            engineering discipline.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Findings</strong></h2>  <!--Examples as collapsibles-->
        <p>
            Different forms of leadership exist for Black and Latinx engineers. 
            While this group shares the experience of being marginalzed within 
            society and in the engineering, different aspects of their 
            identities created different forms of leadership for them to 
            excude. This study revealed two categories of leadership. The first 
            category is traditional leadership. This category is defined by 
            its connection to what society views makes a good leaders such as 
            charisma, being social, strength, and having extensive leadership 
            experience. This presented one archetype with the same name and 
            description as its category. The second category is non-traditional 
            leadership. This category is defined by its subtleness and 
            personalization. These individuals use traits such as observation, 
            personal connection, and introvesion to inspire others to a 
            particular goal. This category contains two archetypes: proactive 
            leadership and self-preserving leadership.

                <h4>Traditional Leader</h4></button>
          <div class="collapsible_content">
              <p>
                Traditional leaders are often what come to mind when you think 
                of a leader. They are outspoken and charismatic,  they naturally 
                take charge of situations, and they are at the center of a team. 
                This group of leaders is able to use the spotlight they have to 
                inspire others to succeed. Jesica showed an example of this when 
                she discussed her involvement as an undergraduate engineer. 
                She says:  
              </p>

              <h4><i>
                “So I ended up joining Delta [Historically Black Sorority]. And 
                then after maybe lika a year after that I did [campus-wide 
                sorority council] because they needed help….I did that for a 
                little…I joined modeling board [part of college government 
                organization]”
              </i></h4>
              <p>
                Jesica’s continued interest and success in different 
                organizations proves a pattern of successful leadership. 
                Traditional leaders ability to be social and captivate an 
                audience allows them to take on numerous leadership roles and 
                continue to see success in them. However, as marginalized 
                engineers,  this group faces unique struggles. This group often 
                feels out of place in engineering. Their difference in racial 
                identity combined with their difference from the softspoken and 
                lack-of-social-skils view of engineering students makes people 
                automatically view them as out of place in the field. Gabrielle 
                shared a similar experience when discussing her experience as a 
                young professional in engineering. Gabrielle says:
              </p>
              <h4><i>
                “...oh, you are so social. You’re so personable. Are you sure 
                chemical engineering is the right field for you?....I felt as 
                if my natural leadership inclination as a well as my rigid 
                worlds that is STEM from the predominantly male, white previous 
                ecosystem.”
              </i></h4>

             <p>
                Though this archetypes is questioned for its presence in the 
                engineering field, their natural ability to inspire a group 
                towards particular goals provides them with a place in the 
                field and the opportunity to expand perspectives. 
            </p>

              <h4>Proactive Non-traditional Leader</h4></button>
          <div class="collapsible_content">
                <p>
                    Proactive non-traditional leaders are driven by their need 
                    to solve individual goals. While they share the same drive 
                    to problem solve as traditional leaders, they are not 
                    equipped the same natural charisma and leadership 
                    experience as traditional leaders. They simply see a 
                    problem in their environment and choose to execute what’s 
                    necessary to fix it. Examples of this form of leadership 
                    can be seen with Dad. He says:
                </p>
                <h4><i>
                    “...there was no active [company branch of  Latinx young 
                    professional organization]....I expressed my concerns to 
                    some other cowokers here and one of them actually put me 
                    in touch with another woman who had similar thoughts…..
                    we founded [company branch of  Latinx young professional 
                    organization] and I am the current president.”
                </i></h4>

                <p>
                    Dad’s journey to becoming the president of his company’s 
                    branch of  the Latinx young professional organization shows 
                    key elements of what it takes to be a proactive 
                    non-traditional leader. Dad’s interest in starting the 
                    chapter was due to seeing a problem and wanting to be 
                    someone who contribute to solving the situation. While Dad 
                    may be inexpereienced and not contain all the traits that 
                    may make him as captivating as traditional leader, his 
                    drive to create the chapter allowed him to be successful, 
                    shown through Dad being the sitting president of the 
                    organization. These leaders also have the ability to 
                    inspire others through being a role model of the goal they 
                    hope to achieve. Killau relates to this experience as he 
                    recalls his leadership experiences. Killau says:
                </p>
                <h4><i>
                    “I’m the kind of person that’s just like, I’d rather just 
                    get it done and do it. I think a lot of people look up to 
                    that…peiple see that and kind of put me in a position where 
                    it's like, oh, he must be a leader because he’s getting it 
                    done.”
                </i></h4>
                <p>
                    Killau’s ability to be a leader by example shows the power 
                    of proactive non-traditioanl leadership. While Killau did 
                    not mean to inspire the other members of his university 
                    organization, he’s behaviour within the organization 
                    encouraged others to do the same for the organization. This 
                    action has the potential to create good habits that push a 
                    team toward their goals.

            <h4> Self-preserving Non-traditional Leader</h4></button>
         <div class="collapsible_content">
              <p>             
                Self-preserving non-traditional leaders are defined by their 
               ability to overcome difficult circumstance while maintaining their
               identity. Due to the harsh environments that often  surround 
               this type of leader, they are able to use their unique traits to 
               find creative solutions. This involves traits such as 
               observation, active listening, and building one-on-one 
               connections. While their impact may be hard to see, they 
               nonetheless have the ability to drive people to meet goals. Jae 
               demonstrated this leadership style while going over her 
               experience in the professional engineering world. She says:  
            </p>
            <h4><i>
                “...sometimes some of the trade contractors are definitely 
                more abrasive and like, trying to tell you what they know, 
                over listening to what you’re trying to tell them…they’re 
                quick to jump down your throat or quick to try an tell you 
                no, before getting your side of things,so I have to be able 
                to kind of on the fly adapt to them.”
            </i></h4>
            <p>
                Jae’s use of her unique personality traits allowed her to 
                inspire other people within her field. Because of the 
                preconvience notions other co-workers had of her, Jae 
                couldn’t directly inspire them to complete a goal. Instead, 
                Jae had to use skills not often associated with leadership 
                such as active listening, trust, and reassurance to build 
                her coworkers confidence in her ability and encourage 
                coworkers to meet the goals of their projects. This 
                leadership allows them to expand the perspective of some of 
                their co-workers and lead their co-workers to particular 
                goals.
