                                        ENGagED REU was a research experience centered 
                                        around engineering education. As a part of this 
                                        program, I learned about different reseach 
                                        methods including qualitative and quantitative 
                                        work, I learned about different methods of data 
                                        analysis such as transcript coding and 
                                        qualitative data analysis, and I learned how to 
                                        convey my research findings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This process has allowed me to get a greater 
                                        understanding of problems within the engineering 
                                        education system and how they effect my journey. 
                                        While you could say engineering education 
                                        is nothing more than a curriculm, the research 
                                        I have come across proves that be a successful 
                                        engineer, multiple things need to be considered 
                                        such as the history of the field, the mental 
                                        health of the participants, the presence of 
                                        leadership in the field, and more.
                                    </p>
