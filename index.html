        <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
        <p><img src="images/twoblackgirls.png" alt="Two Black Girls"
            style="float:right;width:280px;height:260px;">
            There are preconceived notions of what an engineer should be. Though 
            we are living in a growingly diverse world, engineers continue to 
            be seen as white men with a monolithic point of view. This image  
            has created an exclusive environment through discouraging the 
            participation of people of color and discouraging diversity of 
            thought. This discouragement has placed serious limitations on the  
            progression of the engineering field  due to its limited 
            perspective on problems that effect more than just the predominate 
            group in the field.
             
            <br>Marginalized engineers becoming leaders has the power to provide 
            the field with the perspective it desperately needs and encourages 
            their success in the field. While diversity of staff and thought 
            are crucial to expanding the perspective of the engineering field, 
            this perspective can only be provided if it is accepted by 
            individuals in the field. Leaders ability to inspire others to 
            believe a mission or aim for a particular goal equips marginalized 
            engineering leaders with the skills to provide the perspective 
            shift that is needed in the engineering field. Leadership also 
            equips marginalized engineer with the skills to reach levels of 
            success that wouldn’t have possible for other marginalized 
            engineers. This study established archetypes of leadership that 
            allow Black and Latinx engineers to suceed in the field. In this 
            context, success is defined as the academic and professional 
            success, not satisfaction in the field.

        <h2><strong>Participants</strong></h2>
        <p><img src="images/part_graph.png" alt="particapants graph"
            style="float:right;width:600px">
            This study focuses on the stories of five Black and/or Latinx 
            engineering students and young professionals. Their stories 
            provided ensite on the experience of Black and Latinx individuals 
            in engieering education and the professional world. Semi-structured 
            interviews lasting between 1-2 hours were conducted. Each interview 
            was audio-recorded and transcribed. Of the five participants, one 
            was a graduate student and the remaining were young professionals. 
            Two identified as men, two identified as female and one identified 
            as femme-presenting. Their majors included mechanical engineering, 
            civil engineering, chemical engineering, and industrial engineering. 
            Thematic analysis was used to identify leadership archetypes and 
            how their display of leadership allowed them to succeed in their 
            engineering discipline.

        <h2><strong>Findings</strong></h2>  <!--Examples as collapsibles-->
        <p>
            Different forms of leadership exist for Black and Latinx engineers. 
            While this group shares the experience of being marginalzed within 
            society and in the field, different aspects of their identities  
            outside of their race and field created different forms of 
            leadership for them to excude. This study revealed two categories 
            of leadership. The first category is traditional leadership. This 
            category is defined by its connection to what society viewed made 
            a good leaders such as charisma, being social, strength, and having 
            extensive leadership experience. This presented one archetype with 
            the same name and description as its category. The second category 
            is non-traditional leadership. This category is defined by its 
            subtleness and personalization. These individuals use traits such 
            as observation, personal connection, and introvesion to inspire 
            others to a particular goal. This category contains two archetypes: 
            proactive leadership and self-preserving leadership.

              <p>
              <h3>Traditional Leader Archetype</h3>
              Traditional leaders are often what come to mind when you think of 
              a leader. They are outspoken and charismatic,  they naturally 
              take charge of situations, and they are at the center of most a 
              team. This group of leaders is able to use the spotlight they can 
              gather to inspire others to succeed. Jesica was a good example 
              this. She says: 
              </p>

              <p><img src="images/new-jesica-quote.png" alt="Jesica Quote"></p>

              <p>
              Jesica’s continued interest and success in different 
              organizations proves a pattern of successful leadership. 
              Traditional leaders ability to be social and captivate an 
              audience allows them to take on numerous leadership roles and 
              continue to see success in them. However, as marginalized 
              engineers,  this group face unique struggles compared to others 
              have this leadership form. This group often feels out of place in 
              engineering. TTheir difference from softspoken and — view of 
              engineering students makes people automatically view them as 
              misplaced in the field. Gabrielle shared a similar experience 
              when discussing her experience as a a young professional in 
              engineering. Gabrielle says:
              </p>

              <p><img src="images/new-gabrielle-quote.png" alt="Gabrielle Quote"></p>

             <p>
              Though this archetypes is questioned for its presence in the 
              engineering field, their ability to directly inspire a group 
              towards a particular goal provides them with a place in the field 
              and the opportunity to expand perspectives.

          <div class="collapsible_content">
              <p>
              <h3>Proactive Non-traditional Leader</h3>
                Proactive non-traditional leaders are driven by their need to 
                solve individual goals. While they share the same drive to 
                problem solve like traditional leaders, they are not equipp the 
                same amounts of natural charisma and leadership experience as 
                traditional leaders. They simply see a problem in their 
                environment and choose to execute it. Examples of this form of 
                leadership can be seen with Dad. He says:

                <p><img src="images/new-dad-quote.png" alt="Dad Quote"></p>

                <br>Dad’s journey to becoming the president of his HOLA branch 
                shows key elements of what it takes to be a Proactive 
                Non-traditional Leader. Dad’s interest in starting the chapter 
                was due to seeing a problem and wanting to be someone who 
                contribute to solving the situation. While Dad may be 
                inexpereience and not contain all the traits that may make him 
                as captivating as traditional leader, their drive to reach their
                goal allows them to become successful, shown through Dad being 
                the sitting president of the organization. These leaders also 
                have the ability to inspire others through being a role model 
                of the goal they hope to achieve. Killau relates to this 
                experience as he recalled his leadership experience. 
                Killau says:

                <p><img src="images/new-killau-quote.png" alt="Killau Quote"></p>

                <br> Killau’s ability to be a leader by example shows the power 
                of proactive non-traditioanl leadership. While Killau did not 
                mean to inspire the other members of his university 
                organization, he’s behaviour within the organization encourage 
                others to do the same for the organization. This action has the 
                potential to create continued good habits that push a team 
                toward the goals they dream of, a reflection of the power of a 
                role model.

            <h4> Self-Preserving Non-traditional Leader</h4></button>
         <div class="collapsible_content">
              <p>             
              <h3>Self-preserving Non-traditional Leader</h3>
                Self-preserving non-traditional leaders are defined by their 
                ability to overcome great obstacles (maybe be more specific) 
                while still maintaining their identity. Due to the harsh 
                environments that surround them, these leaders are able to use 
                their unique traits to find creative solutions to the 
                challenges they face. This involves traits such as observation, 
                active listening, skill in building one-on-one connectoon, and 
                —-. While their impact may be hard to see, they nonetheless 
                have the ability to drive people to meet goals. Jae 
                demonstrated this leadership style while regarding her 
                experience in the professional engineering world. She says: 
                
                <p><img src="images/new-jae-quote.png" alt="Jae Quote"></p>

                <p>Jae’s use of her unique personality traits allowed her to 
                inspire other people within her field. Because of the 
                preconvience notions other employees had of Jae, she had to use 
                skill s not often associat with leadership such as active 
                listening, trust, and reassurance to build confidence in her 
                ability and encourage coworkers to meet their goals. Because 
                they can not directly inspire teams like other forms of leaders, 
                their introverted and — traits make them a unique form of 
                leadership. This leadership allows them to expand the 
                perspective of some of their employes and lead their employees 
                to particular goals.
